          <h4 class="box-info">Before the 1950s and 1960s, public transit on Staten Island was relatively adequate, with three branch lines of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway, now what is Staten Island Railway, serving the island on the North Shore, South Shore, and the beaches. However, with cars taking over the island during the 60s with the Verrazano Bridge opening in 1964, public transit on the island and between the other 4 boroughs have been nightmarish for many.</h4>

          <h4 class="box-info">Since the beginning of the subway in NYC, there have been plans to expand to the Nassau-Queens county border. Starting first in 1915 with the Flushing Line, now known as the 7 train, attempted plans were made to send trains to Eastern Queens. Other notable attempts include expanding the IND Fulton Street Line to Cambria Heights in a plan that never was completed besides some futureproofing.</h4>
